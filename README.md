The project scope for the 'Jijenge Financial Group' system should define the boundaries and objectives of the system clearly. Here's a suggested project scope for your financial group management system:

Project Scope: 'Jijenge Financial Group' System

Objective:
The 'Jijenge Financial Group' system aims to create an online platform that facilitates financial literacy, responsible savings, loan management, and income-generating projects for its members. The system will empower administrators to manage user accounts, contributions, loans, and announcements, while users will have access to their personal financial data and group-wide announcements.

The group meetings are held at regular intervals, where members meet and discuss matters pertaining to their welfare. 
During the meetings,, the members may:
Contribute savings
Contribute group shares
Borrow loans or repay loans
Discuss and implement a income generating project
With the increase in the number of the group members, managing the groups activities became tedious.
Activities like updating loan balances while increasing interest rates and updating each user's savings balances were prone to many errors often leading to mistrust among members, which led to the need of automation of the process.

Real time notifications
Accurate reports about the group activities

It is fast compared to the manual
Data stored can be accessed at any time
The system is mobile, customers can access it at their pleasure
